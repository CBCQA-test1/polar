## Overview ##

Polaris Extension for Azure DevOps helps security and development teams analyze security risks in their software products. The Synopsys Polaris Extension for Azure DevOps enables you to invoke Synopsys Polaris analysis from your Azure DevOps pipelines.

As a Synopsys and Azure DevOps user, the Synopsys Polaris Extension for Azure DevOps enables you to:
1. Run an automatic Polaris scan through an Azure DevOps pipeline job
2. After a scan is complete, the results are available on the Synopsys Polaris server
3. If issues are found, the extension can fail the build
