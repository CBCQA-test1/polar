## Overview ##

Polaris Software Integrity Platform Extension for Azure DevOps helps security and development teams analyze security risks in their software products.

1. Run an automatic Polaris Software Integrity Platform scan through an Azure DevOps pipeline job
2. After a scan is complete, the results are available on the Polaris Software Integrity Platform server
3. If issues are found, the extension can fail the build
